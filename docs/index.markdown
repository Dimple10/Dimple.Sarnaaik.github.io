I am a 4th year graduate student studying Cosmology at the University of Southern California. My research focuses on exploring Dark Matter models through various astrophysical methodologies. I work with Kris Pardo at USC and Andrew Benson at the Carnegie Observatories. I aim to use Astrophysics to help find the true model of Dark Matter for our Universe.
