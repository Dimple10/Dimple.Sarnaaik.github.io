Hunting Dark Matter Subhalos with Roman Space telescope

The number of predicted DM subhalos vary from model to model. My research uses the basis of weak gravitational lensing signal set to be observed by the 
Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope in our galaxy center to detect the effect of these subhalos. I forward model the signal we should observe for different DM models allowing us to probe
the low mass regime of DM. 

Dark Matter Merger Trees for different DM models

Using Galaciticus, a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, I analyze the Symphony simulation suite of different DM models by looking at their merger history.
